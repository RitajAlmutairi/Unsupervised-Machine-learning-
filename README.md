# Unsupervised-Machine-learning-

### Project Description.
## In this project, we implemented unsupervised clustering algorithms  KMeans, and DBSCAN from scratch GMM, and hierarchical clustering provided by the Sklearn library.  I used multiple artificial datasets like make_blobs, make_moons, and make_circles provided by sikit-learn and the dataset "Mall Customers". Different datasets are used to evaluate the efficiency of each algorithm and compare the outcomes. This project is a group project,This project is a collaborative effort with @/KhadejaYahya and shahad Alharbi AKA @/shduv0 ![download](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107959885/229289932-432aa34e-92d2-41ad-94d1-2279788dbe3d.png)
